  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Transparency First</h3>

    <p>
      Every participant deserves full clarity.
      Information, decisions, and results are shared openly,
      so that trust is built and maintained.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hidden agendas or selective disclosure have no place in B2H.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Fairness Above All</h3>

    <p>
      B2H acts in the interest of all participants,
      without favoritism, bias, or manipulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every burn, every decision, every action is designed
      to protect the community and uphold fairness.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 3 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Responsibility & Accountability</h3>

    <p>
      Actions have consequences — and B2H owns them.
      Decisions are made with care,
      participants are informed,
      and mistakes are acknowledged transparently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Accountability is not optional; it is central to the mission.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 4 -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Respect for Humanity</h3>

    <p>
      Every participant is treated with dignity.
      Helping humanity comes first,
      and no short-term gains justify harm or exploitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The B2H community thrives when people feel safe, valued, and respected.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 5 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Long-Term Vision</h3>

    <p>
      Ethical behavior is sustainable.
      Shortcuts or compromises that erode trust
      are rejected in favor of actions
      that build lasting impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Integrity is the bridge between today’s actions
      and tomorrow’s mission.
