  <h3>Ethics & Values</h3>

  <p>
    B2H (Burn to Help | Born for Humanity) is built on ethical responsibility,
    human dignity, and long-term trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project does not exist to exploit emotions, manipulate belief,
    or pressure participation. Every interaction with B2H is intended
    to remain voluntary, transparent, and respectful.
  </p>

  <h3>Humanity Before Profit</h3>

  <p>
    B2H does not prioritize profit over people.
    Financial mechanisms, if any, exist only to support sustainability
    and humanitarian impact — never to justify harm, deception,
    or excess.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a decision benefits growth but harms human dignity,
    it must not be taken.
  </p>

  <h3>No Exploitation, No Pressure</h3>

  <p>
    B2H rejects fear-based messaging, artificial urgency,
    and promises of guaranteed outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    No one should feel pressured to participate.
    No one should feel ashamed for not participating.
    Ethics require freedom of choice.
  </p>

  <h3>Truth, Transparency, Responsibility</h3>

  <p>
    All public communication must be honest, understandable,
    and free from exaggeration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transparency is treated as a responsibility, not a marketing tool.
    Mistakes, limitations, and uncertainties must be acknowledged
    rather than hidden.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Faith, Conscience, and Respect</h3>

  <p>
    B2H is inspired by conscience and moral responsibility.
    It respects people of all backgrounds and beliefs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Faith is never used as pressure.
    Compassion is never used as leverage.
    Help is never conditional.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Long-Term Integrity</h3>

  <p>
    Ethical integrity matters more than speed, popularity,
    or short-term success.
  </p>

  <p>
    If maintaining ethics ever requires slowing down,
    restructuring, or refusing opportunity,
    that choice must be made without hesitation.
