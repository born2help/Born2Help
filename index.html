  <!-- Founder Quotes -->
  <div class="founder-quote">
    <p>
      “This mission was not created for wealth, power, or recognition.
      It was created because silence in the face of suffering is also a form of injustice.”
    </p>
    <p class="founder-name">— Founder, B2H (Burn to Help)</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Mission -->
  <div class="mission-card">
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      B2H was not created as a trend, a business, or a promise of quick wealth.
      It was created from responsibility — toward people who suffer quietly,
      and toward Allah, who sees every intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      B2H exists to become that someone — to transform participation into relief,
      value into dignity, and growth into real human impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mission is lifelong: to reduce suffering, protect dignity,
      and ensure that helping others remains at the heart of everything we do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the world, millions endure silently, hoping that someone still cares.
      B2H exists to become that someone.
