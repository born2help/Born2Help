  <!-- Mission -->
  <div class="mission-card">
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>B2H was not created as a trend, a business, or a promise of quick wealth. It was created from responsibility — toward people who suffer quietly, and toward Allah, who sees every intention.</p>
    <p>B2H exists to become that someone — to transform participation into relief, value into dignity, and growth into real human impact.</p>
    <p>This mission is permanent, guided by our <a href="#mission-lock">Mission Lock & Ethical Permanence</a>. Helping others is non-negotiable; ethical participation is required for every action.</p>
    <p>Around the world, millions endure with dignity while hoping that someone, somewhere, still cares. B2H exists to become that someone.</p>
