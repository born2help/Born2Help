<section class="section">
  <h3>What “Burn” Means</h3>
  <p>
    In B2H, a burn is a conscious decision: value is reduced in one place
    to create relief, stability, and long-term service elsewhere.
    It is not about hype or artificial scarcity.
  </p>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>How Burns Serve Humanity</h3>
  <p>
    Burns are tied to real-world responsibility. Contributions are directed
    toward humanitarian purposes, operational sustainability, and continued service.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Ethics in Action</h3>
  <p>
    All decisions at B2H follow strict ethical guidelines: transparency,
    no personal enrichment, no interest (Riba), and trust-based allocation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ethics is the backbone of every contribution, burn, and participation.
    No outcome justifies violating our values.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Mission First</h3>
  <p>
    B2H exists to help humanity. Financial outcomes, if any, are secondary
    and never guaranteed. The mission always comes first.
