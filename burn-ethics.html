    <h1>Burn & Ethics for Humanity</h1>
    <h2>Responsible actions, ethical impact — B2H</h2>
    <p>
      In B2H, every burn and every action follows a conscious ethical framework.
      Growth is meaningful only when it reduces suffering, protects dignity,
      and aligns with faith and humanity.

<!-- ================= WHAT BURN MEANS ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h3>What “Burn” Means in B2H</h3>
  <p>
    In B2H, burning is not destruction. It is a conscious act of responsibility
    to reduce value in one area so that relief, stability, and long-term service
    can exist elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not about creating hype or artificial scarcity.
    It is about enabling real impact, protecting dignity, and keeping the mission alive.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= HOW BURNS SERVE HUMANITY ================= -->
<section class="section light">
  <h3>How Burns Serve Humanity</h3>
  <p>
    Burns are linked to real-world responsibility. A portion of what is sacrificed
    is directed toward humanitarian purposes, operational sustainability, and continued service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Helping people is never treated as a marketing strategy —
    it is treated as an obligation.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= ETHICAL PRINCIPLES ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h3>Ethical Principles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No interest (Riba) or exploitation</li>
    <li>No personal enrichment — every action serves humanity</li>
    <li>Transparency and accountability in all processes</li>
    <li>Long-term sustainability over short-term gains</li>
    <li>Faith-aligned decision-making and moral responsibility</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROTECTION FOR PARTICIPANTS ================= -->
<section class="section light">
  <h3>Protection for Participants</h3>
  <p>
    Participants and their families are considered in every action.
    Burns and operations are balanced — never reckless, emotional, or short-term driven.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is sustainability and trust. Helping others must never require
    sacrificing integrity or dignity.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= FAITH, ACCOUNTABILITY & PERMANENCE ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h3>Faith, Accountability & Permanence</h3>
  <p>
    This project exists with the belief that intention matters.
    Every burn and decision is carried out with accountability, transparency,
    and respect for human dignity.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a burn or action does not serve humanity or protect participants,
    it does not belong in B2H.
