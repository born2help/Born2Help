    <h1>Burn & Ethics</h1>
    <h2>When Value is Sacrificed, Humanity Rises</h2>
    <p>
      In B2H, burning is not destruction. It is a conscious act of responsibility.
      Ethics guide every action to ensure impact, transparency, and protection.

<!-- ================= BURN CONTENT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h3>What “Burn” Means in B2H</h3>
  <p>
    In many projects, burns are used only to create hype or artificial scarcity.
    B2H rejects that mindset.
  </p>
  <p>
    In B2H, a burn represents a conscious decision: value is reduced in one place so that
    relief, stability, and long-term service can exist elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not about making numbers look attractive. It is about making impact possible.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>How Burns Serve Humanity</h3>
  <p>
    Burns in B2H are linked to real-world responsibility.
    Portions of value sacrificed are directed toward humanitarian purposes,
    operational sustainability, and continued service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Helping people is treated as an obligation, not a marketing strategy.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Protection for Participants</h3>
  <p>
    B2H participants think about their families and long-term security.
    Burns are designed to be balanced, never reckless, and never driven by short-term pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is sustainability—helping others without sacrificing trust.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Faith, Accountability & Permanence</h3>
  <p>
    Every burn is carried out with accountability, transparency, and respect for human dignity.
    If a burn does not serve humanity, strengthen the mission, or protect participants,
    it does not belong in B2H.
  </p>

<!-- ================= ETHICS CONTENT ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h3>Ethical Principles of B2H</h3>
  <p>
    B2H is guided by ethics: no personal enrichment, no exploitation,
    and every contribution serves humanity only.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Transparency & Use of Funds</h3>
  <p>
    Contributions are strictly used for humanitarian relief, operational sustainability,
    and mission continuity. No personal gain is allowed.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Zero Interest Policy</h3>
  <p>
    B2H never lends, grows, or circulates funds through interest (Riba).
    All financial movement follows ethical and faith-aligned principles.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light" id="founder">
  <h3>Founder Safeguards</h3>
  <p>
    The Founder holds no ownership or financial privilege. Authority exists solely
    to safeguard the mission, prevent misuse, and activate mission-first protections
    in emergencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    No personal benefit is allowed. Participants and donors can trust that the
    framework protects them at all times.
