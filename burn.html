      <p>
        In B2H, burning is not destruction.
        It is a conscious act of responsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every burn exists to protect dignity,
        reduce suffering,
        and preserve the mission.

  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>What “Burn” Means in B2H</h3>

    <p>
      In many projects, token burns are used
      purely to create hype or artificial scarcity.
      B2H rejects that mindset entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      In B2H, a burn represents a conscious decision:
      value is reduced in one place
      so that relief, stability,
      and long-term service can exist elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not about attractive numbers.
      It is about meaningful impact.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>How Burns Serve Humanity</h3>

    <p>
      When burns occur in B2H,
      they are linked to responsibility —
      humanitarian support,
      operational sustainability,
      and protection of the mission.
    </p>

    <p>
      This allows B2H to help people today
      without destroying the future of the project tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Helping people is not a marketing strategy.
      It is an obligation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 3 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Protection for Participants</h3>

    <p>
      B2H recognizes that participants
      think not only of today,
      but of their families,
      their children,
      and long-term security.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason, burns are designed with balance:
      never reckless,
      never emotional,
      never driven by pressure or hype.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sustainability is the priority —
      because trust, once broken,
      cannot be burned back into existence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 4 -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Faith, Accountability & Permanence</h3>

    <p>
      This project exists with the belief
      that Allah sees intention before outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every burn is executed with accountability,
      transparency,
      and respect for human dignity.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a burn does not serve humanity,
      strengthen the mission,
      or protect participants,
      it does not belong in B2H.
