  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Total Supply</h3>

    <p>
      B2H has a fixed total supply designed for sustainability.
      This ensures scarcity, long-term value, and responsible management.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Total Supply:</strong> 1,000,000,000 B2H Tokens
    </p>

    <h3>Token Allocation</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Community & Participation:</strong> 40%</li>
      <li><strong>Burn Mechanism:</strong> 25%</li>
      <li><strong>Operations & Development:</strong> 20%</li>
      <li><strong>Team & Advisors:</strong> 10%</li>
      <li><strong>Reserve & Contingency:</strong> 5%</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 3 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Burn Strategy</h3>

    <p>
      Burns are intentional and serve the mission of humanity.
      Tokens are permanently removed from circulation in a controlled manner,
      increasing scarcity and supporting long-term value.
    </p>

    <p>
      B2H does not burn tokens for hype — every burn has a purpose.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 4 -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Distribution Principles</h3>

    <p>
      Tokens are distributed to participants in a transparent and fair manner.
      Early contributors, community participants, and service providers are rewarded
      without bias or favoritism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each distribution follows clearly defined rules and documented processes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 5 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Long-Term Sustainability</h3>

    <p>
      Tokenomics is not just numbers; it is a plan for longevity.
      Allocations, burns, and reserves are designed to ensure
      B2H continues to serve humanity for years to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every token has a purpose, every action is guided by ethics.
